__QUICK NOTES__

File>> open folder 
Terminal>> new terminal 

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip


if you need to, install pipreqs, on your default python terminal 
pip install pipreqs
then CD to your root directory 
then run (use --force to force overwrite) 
pipreqs .

Note this is just a quick initial fix and version issues may need to be considered later. 
run unit tests if they exist. 


pip3 install -r pip_start.txt # generic packages to quickly get started on a project
OR 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

pip install pipreqs # should already be installed on my mac 
#then
pipreqs path/to/project


for example 

(base) phil@Phillips-MacBook-Pro ~ % pipreqs /Users/phil/Dropbox/GITHUB/nillip/nillip
INFO: Successfully saved requirements file in /Users/phil/Dropbox/GITHUB/nillip/nillip/requirements.txt
#################pip freeze > requirements.txt



__JUPYTER__
Must install ipython (see in pip_start.txt file) (ipykernel)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58119823/jupyter-notebooks-in-visual-studio-code-does-not-use-the-active-virtual-environm

STEP 1
pip install ipykernel


You must RESTART VS Code after you pip install, specifically for 'ipykernel'. 
But just always do it to be safe. 
ALSO leave 'user' as 'user' and just change the project name 

Then use 
ipython kernel install --user --name=EXAMPLE_PROJECT_NAME
E.G. >>>ipython kernel install --user --name=scrapifurs

ipython kernel install --user --name=scrapifurs


Where EXAMPLE_PROJECT_NAME is what you want to name it so make it match the name of your project 
folder to stay organized. Note this is just a name and it will run whatever virtual 
environment you run that line from. 

This installs the venv onto jupyter, then you can type 
jupyter notebook
Then select the environment you want to use with when creating a new .ipynb file. 




UNINSTALL jupyter VENV

From a given venv type
jupyter kernelspec uninstall EXAMPLE_PROJECT_NAME


__PYTORCH__
Systems require different versions go here to check out what to download 
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
For my MBP 2015 it is 
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio



__MISC__


set python default in mac 

echo "alias python='/usr/local/bin/python3'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
